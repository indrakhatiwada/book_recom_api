api for book recommendation using collaborative filtering

# The API is made using fastAPi and this is my first time doing pytohn
## After installing the requirements from requirements.txt and firing up the server you can visit the fastAPi docs at localhost:port/docs and try the api there.
## it takes request in form of get as GET localhost:port/predict/?book_name where book_name is the param you want to predict the suggestions for.
